# CONFIGURATION
# Top-level keys are categorical; where possible, introduce
# new top-level keys to keep constants/ideas separate.
# Note that we parse this with the configuration library,
# which has some fancy extensions to allow referencing between
# different elements in the YAML file.
# See http://configure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#
